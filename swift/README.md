# Swift(UI)

## 1. A Swift Tour

Launch XCode and create a new blank Playground for iOS (File > New > Playground). Name it `SwiftTour` and save it somewhere on your computer. A Playground is a great way to learn Swift because it allows you to write code and see the results immediately. It's also a great way to experiment with new ideas, without having to create a full-blown app.

Follow the [Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour/) - make sure to use the latest XCode version - from the Swift documentation. You can copy and paste the code from the documentation into your Playground. You can also type the code yourself, which is a great way to learn. If you get stuck, you can always refer to the documentation for help.

## 2. SwiftUI

Watch the [Video: Introduction to SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10119/).

We will build a small App in class, based upon the principles demonstrated in that video.
